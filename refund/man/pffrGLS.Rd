\usage{
pffrGLS(formula, yind, hatSigma, algorithm = NA, method = "REML",
  tensortype = c("te", "t2"), bs.yindex = list(bs = "ps", k = 5, m = c(2,
  1)), bs.int = list(bs = "ps", k = 20, m = c(2, 1)), cond.cutoff = 500,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a formula with special terms as for \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}}, with additional special terms \code{\link{ff}()} and \code{c()}. See \code{\link[refund]{pffr}}.}

\item{yind}{a vector with length equal to the number of columns of the matrix of functional responses giving the vector of evaluation points \eqn{(t_1, \dots ,t_{G})}.
see \code{\link[refund]{pffr}}}

\item{hatSigma}{(an estimate of) the within-observation covariance (along the responses' index), evaluated at \code{yind}. See Details.}

\item{algorithm}{the name of the function used to estimate the model. Defaults to \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} if the matrix of functional responses has less than \code{2e5} data points
and to \code{\link[mgcv]{bam}} if not. "gamm" (see \code{\link[mgcv]{gamm}}) and "gamm4" (see \code{\link[gamm4]{gamm4}}) are valid options as well.}

\item{method}{See \code{\link[refund]{pffr}}}

\item{tensortype}{See \code{\link[refund]{pffr}}}

\item{bs.yindex}{See \code{\link[refund]{pffr}}}

\item{bs.int}{See \code{\link[refund]{pffr}}}

\item{cond.cutoff}{if the condition number of \code{hatSigma} is greater than this,  \code{hatSigma} is
made ``more'' positive-definite via \code{\link[Matrix]{nearPD}} to ensure a condition number equal to cond.cutoff. Defaults to 500.}

\item{...}{additional arguments that are valid for \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} or \code{\link[mgcv]{bam}}. See \code{\link[refund]{pffr}}.}
}
\value{
a fitted \code{pffr}-object, see \code{\link[refund]{pffr}}.

\description{
Implements additive regression for functional and scalar covariates and functional responses.
This function is a wrapper for \code{mgcv}'s \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} and its siblings to fit models of the general form \cr
\eqn{Y_i(t) = \mu(t) + \int X_i(s)\beta(s,t)ds + f(z_{1i}, t) + f(z_{2i}) + z_{3i} \beta_3(t) + \dots  + E_i(t))}\cr
with a functional (but not necessarily continuous) response \eqn{Y(t)},
(optional) smooth intercept \eqn{\mu(t)}, (multiple) functional covariates \eqn{X(t)} and scalar covariates
\eqn{z_1}, \eqn{z_2}, etc. The residual functions \eqn{E_i(t) \sim GP(0, K(t,t'))} are assumed to be i.i.d.
realizations of a Gaussian process. An estimate of the covariance operator \eqn{K(t,t')} evaluated on \code{yind}
has to be supplied in the \code{hatSigma}-argument.
}
\section{Details}{

Note that \code{hatSigma} has to be positive definite. If \code{hatSigma} is close to positive \emph{semi-}definite or badly conditioned,
estimated standard errors become unstable (typically much too small). \code{pffrGLS} will try to diagnose this and issue a warning.
The danger is especially big if the number of functional observations is smaller than the number of gridpoints
(i.e, \code{length(yind)}), since the raw covariance estimate will not have full rank.\cr
Please see \code{\link[refund]{pffr}} for details on model specification and
implementation. \cr THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL VERSION AND NOT WELL TESTED YET -- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
