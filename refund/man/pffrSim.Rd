\usage{
pffrSim(scenario = "all", n = 100, nxgrid = 40, nygrid = 60, SNR = 10,
  propmissing = 0, limits = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{scenario}{see Description}

\item{n}{number of observations}

\item{nxgrid}{number of evaluation points of functional covariates}

\item{nygrid}{number of evaluation points of the functional response}

\item{SNR}{the signal-to-noise ratio for the generated data: empirical
variance of the additive predictor divided by variance of the errors.}

\item{propmissing}{proportion of missing data in the response, default = 0.
See Details.}

\item{limits}{a function that defines an integration range, see
\code{\link{ff}}}
}
\value{
a named list with the simulated data, and the true components of the
  predictor etc as attributes.

\description{
Simulates example data for \code{\link{pffr}} from a variety of terms.
Scenario "all" generates data from a complex multivariate model \deqn{Y_i(t)
= \mu(t) + \int X_{1i}(s)\beta_1(s,t)ds + xlin \beta_3(t) + f(xte1, xte2) +
f(xsmoo, t) + \beta_4 xconst + \epsilon_i(t)}. Scenarios "int", "ff", "lin",
"te", "smoo", "const" generate data from simpler models containing only the
respective term(s)  in the model equation given above. Specifiying a
vector-valued scenario will generate data from a combination of the
respective terms. Sparse/irregular response trajectories can be generated by
setting \code{propmissing} to something greater than 0 (and smaller than 1).
The return object then also includes a \code{ydata}-item with the sparsified
data.
