\usage{
ff(X, yind = NULL, xind = seq(0, 1, l = ncol(X)), basistype = c("te",
  "t2", "s"), integration = c("simpson", "trapezoidal", "riemann"),
  L = NULL, limits = NULL, splinepars = if (basistype != "s") {    
  list(bs = "ps", m = list(c(2, 1), c(2, 1))) } else {     list(bs = "tp", m =
  NA) }, check.ident = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{an n by \code{ncol(xind)} matrix of function evaluations
\eqn{X_i(s_{i1}),\dots, X_i(s_{iS})}; \eqn{i=1,\dots,n}.}

\item{yind}{\emph{DEPRECATED} used to supply matrix (or vector) of indices of
evaluations of \eqn{Y_i(t)}, no longer used.}

\item{xind}{matrix (or vector) of indices of evaluations of \eqn{X_i(s)};
i.e. matrix with rows \eqn{(s_{i1},\dots,s_{iS})}}

\item{basistype}{defaults to "\code{\link[mgcv]{te}}", i.e. a tensor product
spline to represent \eqn{\beta(t,s)}. Alternatively, use \code{"s"} for
bivariate basis functions (see \code{mgcv}'s \code{\link[mgcv]{s}}) or
\code{"t2"} for an alternative parameterization of tensor product splines
(see \code{mgcv}'s \code{\link[mgcv]{t2}}).}

\item{integration}{method used for numerical integration. Defaults to
\code{"simpson"}'s rule for calculating entries in \code{L}. Alternatively
and for non-equidistant grids, \code{"trapezoidal"} or \code{"riemann"}.
\code{"riemann"} integration is always used if \code{limits} is specified}

\item{L}{optional: an n by \code{ncol(xind)} matrix giving the weights for
the numerical integration over \eqn{s}.}

\item{limits}{defaults to NULL for integration across the entire range of
\eqn{X(s)}, otherwise specifies the integration limits \eqn{s_{hi, i},
s_{lo, i}}: either one of \code{"s<t"} or \code{"s<=t"} for \eqn{(s_{hi,
i}, s_{lo, i}) = (0, t)} or a function that takes \code{s} as the first and
\code{t} as the second argument and returns TRUE for combinations of values
\code{(s,t)} if \code{s} falls into the integration range for the given
\code{t}. This is an experimental feature and not well tested yet; use at
your own risk.}

\item{splinepars}{optional arguments supplied to the \code{basistype}-term.
Defaults to a cubic tensor product B-spline with marginal first difference
penalties, i.e. \code{list(bs="ps", m=list(c(2, 1), c(2,1)))}. See
\code{\link[mgcv]{te}} or \code{\link[mgcv]{s}} in \pkg{mgcv} for details}

\item{check.ident}{check identifiability of the model spec. See Details and
  References. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
a list containing \itemize{ \item \code{call} a "call" to
  \code{\link[mgcv]{te}} (or \code{\link[mgcv]{s}}, \code{\link[mgcv]{t2}})
  using the appropriately constructed covariate and weight matrices \item
  \code{data} a list containing the necessary covariate and weight matrices }
}
\description{
Defines a term \eqn{\int^{s_{hi, i}}_{s_{lo, i}} X_i(s)\beta(t,s)ds} for
inclusion in an \code{mgcv::gam}-formula (or \code{bam} or \code{gamm} or
\code{gamm4:::gamm4}) as constructed by \code{\link{pffr}}. \cr Defaults to a
cubic tensor product B-spline with marginal first order differences penalties
for \eqn{\beta(t,s)} and numerical integration over the entire range
\eqn{[s_{lo, i}, s_{hi, i}] = [\min(s_i), \max(s_i)]} by using Simpson
weights. Can't deal with any missing \eqn{X(s)}, unequal lengths of
\eqn{X_i(s)} not (yet?) possible. Unequal integration ranges for different
\eqn{X_i(s)} should work. \eqn{X_i(s)} is assumed to be numeric (duh...).
}
\details{
If \code{check.ident==TRUE} and \code{basistype!="s"}  (the default), the
routine checks for overlap between the kernels of Cov\eqn{(X(s))} and the
marginal penalty over \code{s}, as well as for sufficient rank of
Cov\eqn{(X(s))}. If there is overlap of the kernels, the penalty and basis
for the covariate direction are changed to B-splines with a modified
`shrinkage' penalty, see \code{\link{smooth.construct.pss.smooth.spec}}. A
warning is given if the effective rank of Cov\eqn{(X(s))} (defined the number
of eigenvalues accounting for at least 0.995 of the total variance in
\eqn{X_i(s)}) is lower than the dimension of the basis for the covariate
direction. See reference for details. Using an \code{\link{ffpc}}-term may be
preferable if \eqn{X_i(s)} is of very low rank.
