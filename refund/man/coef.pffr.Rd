\title{Get estimated coefficients from a pffr fit}
\usage{
\method{coef}{pffr}(object, raw = FALSE, se = TRUE, freq = FALSE,
  sandwich = FALSE, seWithMean = TRUE, n1 = 100, n2 = 40, n3 = 20,
  Ktt = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted \code{pffr}-object}

\item{raw}{logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, the function simply returns \code{object$coefficients}}

\item{se}{logical, defaults to TRUE. Return estimated standard error of the estimates?}

\item{freq}{logical, defaults to FALSE. If FALSE, use posterior variance \code{object$Vp} for variability estimates,
else use \code{object$Ve}. See \code{\link[mgcv]{gamObject}}}

\item{sandwich}{logical, defaults to FALSE. Use a Sandwich-estimator for approximate variances? See Details.
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE, USE A YOUR OWN RISK.}

\item{seWithMean}{logical, defaults to TRUE. Include uncertainty about the intercept/overall mean in  standard errors returned for smooth components?}

\item{n1}{see below}

\item{n2}{see below}

\item{n3}{\code{n1, n2, n3} give the number of gridpoints for 1-/2-/3-dimensional smooth terms
used in the marginal equidistant grids over the range of the covariates at which the estimated effects are evaluated.}

\item{Ktt}{(optional) an estimate of the covariance operator of the residual process \eqn{\epsilon_i(t) \sim N(0, K(t,t'))},
evaluated on \code{yind} of \code{object}. If not supplied, this is estimated from the crossproduct matrices of the
observed residual vectors. Only relevant for sandwich CIs.}

\item{...}{other arguments, not used.}
}
\value{
If \code{raw==FALSE}, a list containing \itemize{
 \item \code{pterms} a matrix containing the parametric / non-functional coefficients (and, optionally, their se's)
 \item \code{smterms} a named list with one entry for each smooth term in the model. Each entry contains
    \itemize{
         \item \code{coef} a matrix giving the grid values over the covariates, the estimated effect (and, optionally, the se's).
                         The first covariate varies the fastest.
         \item \code{x, y, z} the unique gridpoints used to evaluate the smooth/coefficient function/coefficient surface
         \item \code{xlim, ylim, zlim} the extent of the x/y/z-axes
         \item \code{xlab, ylab, zlab} the names of the covariates for the x/y/z-axes
         \item \code{dim} the dimensionality of the effect
         \item \code{main} the label of the smooth term (a short label, same as the one used in \code{summary.pffr})
}}
}
\description{
Returns estimated coefficient functions/surfaces \eqn{\beta(t), \beta(s,t)}
and estimated smooth effects \eqn{f(z), f(x,z)} or \eqn{f(x, z, t)} and their point-wise estimated standard errors.
Not implemented for smooths in more than 3 dimensions.

\details{
The \code{seWithMean}-option corresponds to the \code{"iterms"}-option in \code{\link[mgcv]{predict.gam}}.
The \code{sandwich}-options works as follows: Assuming that the residual vectors \eqn{\epsilon_i(t), i=1,\dots,n} are i.i.d.
realizations of a mean zero Gaussian process with covariance \eqn{K(t,t')}, we can construct an estimator for
\eqn{K(t,t')} from the \eqn{n} replicates of the observed residual vectors. The covariance matrix of the stacked observations
vec\eqn{(Y_i(t))} is then given by a block-diagonal matrix with \eqn{n} copies of the estimated \eqn{K(t,t')} on the diagonal.
This block-diagonal matrix is used to construct the "meat" of a sandwich covariance estimator, similar to Chen et al. (2012),
see reference below.
