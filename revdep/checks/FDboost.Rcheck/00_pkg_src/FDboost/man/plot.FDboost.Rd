\title{Plot the fit or the coefficients of a boosted functional regression model}
\usage{
\method{plot}{FDboost}(x, raw = FALSE, rug = TRUE, which = NULL,
  includeOffset = TRUE, ask = TRUE, n1 = 40, n2 = 40, n3 = 20,
  n4 = 11, onlySelected = TRUE, pers = FALSE, commonRange = FALSE, ...)

plotPredicted(x, subset = NULL, posLegend = "topleft", lwdObs = 1,
  lwdPred = 1, ...)

plotResiduals(x, subset = NULL, posLegend = "topleft", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a fitted \code{FDboost}-object}

\item{raw}{logical defaults to \code{FALSE}.
If \code{raw = FALSE} for each effect the estimated function/surface is calculated. 
If \code{raw = TRUE} the coefficients of the model are returned.}

\item{rug}{when \code{TRUE} (default) then the covariate to which the plot applies is 
displayed as a rug plot at the foot of each plot of a 1-d smooth, 
and the locations of the covariates are plotted as points on the contour plot 
representing a 2-d smooth.}

\item{which}{a subset of base-learners to take into account for plotting.}

\item{includeOffset}{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. Should the offset be included in 
the plot of the intercept (default) or should it be plotted separately.}

\item{ask}{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}, if several effects are plotted the user
has to hit Return to see next plot.}

\item{n1}{see below}

\item{n2}{see below}

\item{n3}{n1, n2, n3 give the number of grid-points for 1-/2-/3-dimensional 
smooth terms used in the marginal equidistant grids over the range of the 
covariates at which the estimated effects are evaluated.}

\item{n4}{gives the number of points for the third dimension in a 3-dimensional smooth term}

\item{onlySelected, }{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. Only plot effects that where 
selected in at least one boosting iteration.}

\item{pers}{logical, defaults to \code{FALSE}, 
If \code{TRUE}, perspective plots (\code{\link[graphics]{persp}}) for 
2- and 3-dimensional effects are drawn.
If \code{FALSE}, image/contour-plots (\code{\link[graphics]{image}}, 
\code{\link[graphics]{contour}}) are drawn for 2- and 3-dimensional effects.}

\item{commonRange}{logical, defaults to \code{FALSE}, 
if \code{TRUE} the range over all effects is the same 
(does not affect perspecitve or image plots).}

\item{...}{other arguments, passed to \code{funplot} (only used in plotPredicted)}

\item{subset}{subset of the observed response curves and their predictions that is plotted. 
Per default all observations are plotted.}

\item{posLegend}{location of the legend, if a legend is drawn automatically 
(only used in plotPredicted). The default is "topleft".}

\item{lwdObs}{lwd of observed curves (only used in plotPredicted)}

\item{lwdPred}{lwd of predicted curves (only used in plotPredicted)}
}
\description{
Takes a fitted \code{FDboost}-object produced by \code{\link{FDboost}()} and 
plots the fitted effects or the coefficient-functions/surfaces.

\seealso{
\code{\link{FDboost}} for the model fit and 
\code{\link{coef.FDboost}} for the calculation of the coefficient functions.
