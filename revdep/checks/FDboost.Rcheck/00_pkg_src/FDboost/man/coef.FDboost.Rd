\usage{
\method{coef}{FDboost}(object, raw = FALSE, which = NULL,
  computeCoef = TRUE, returnData = FALSE, n1 = 40, n2 = 40, n3 = 20,
  n4 = 10, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted \code{FDboost}-object}

\item{raw}{logical defaults to \code{FALSE}.
If \code{raw = FALSE} for each effect the estimated function/surface is calculated. 
If \code{raw = TRUE} the coefficients of the model are returned.}

\item{which}{a subset of base-learners for which the coefficients
should be computed (numeric vector), 
defaults to NULL which is the same as \code{which=1:length(object$baselearner)}.
In the special case of \code{which=0}, only the coefficients of the offset are returned.}

\item{computeCoef}{defaults to \code{TRUE}, if \code{FALSE} only the names of the terms are returned}

\item{returnData}{return the dataset which is used to get the coefficient estimates as 
predictions, see Details.}

\item{n1}{see below}

\item{n2}{see below}

\item{n3}{n1, n2, n3 give the number of grid-points for 1-/2-/3-dimensional 
smooth terms used in the marginal equidistant grids over the range of the 
covariates at which the estimated effects are evaluated.}

\item{n4}{gives the number of points for the third dimension in a 3-dimensional smooth term}

\item{...}{other arguments, not used.}
}
\value{
If \code{raw = FALSE}, a list containing 
\itemize{
 \item \code{offset} a list with plot information for the offset.
 \item \code{smterms} a named list with one entry for each smooth term in the model. 
 Each entry contains
    \itemize{
         \item \code{x, y, z} the unique grid-points used to evaluate the smooth/coefficient function/coefficient surface
         \item \code{xlim, ylim, zlim} the extent of the x/y/z-axes
         \item \code{xlab, ylab, zlab} the names of the covariates for the x/y/z-axes
         \item \code{value} a vector/matrix/list of matrices containing the coefficient values 
         \item \code{dim} the dimensionality of the effect
         \item \code{main} the label of the smooth term (a short label)
}} 
If \code{raw = TRUE}, a list containing the estimated spline coefficients.
}
\description{
Takes a fitted \code{FDboost}-object produced by \code{\link{FDboost}()} and 
returns estimated coefficient functions/surfaces \eqn{\beta(t), \beta(s,t)} and 
estimated smooth effects \eqn{f(z), f(x,z)} or \eqn{f(x, z, t)}. 
Not implemented for smooths in more than 3 dimensions.
}
\details{
If \code{raw = FALSE} the function \code{coef.FDboost} generates adequate dummy data 
and uses the function \code{predict.FDboost} to 
compute the estimated coefficient functions.
