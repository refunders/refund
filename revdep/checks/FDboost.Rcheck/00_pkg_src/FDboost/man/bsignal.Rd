}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix of functional variable x(s). The functional covariate has to be 
supplied as n by <no. of evaluations> matrix, i.e., each row is one functional observation.}

\item{s}{vector for the index of the functional variable x(s) giving the 
measurement points of the functional covariate.}

\item{index}{a vector of integers for expanding the covariate in \code{x} 
For example, \code{bsignal(X, s, index = index)} is equal to \code{bsignal(X[index,], s)}, 
where index is an integer of length greater or equal to \code{NROW(x)}.}

\item{inS}{the functional effect can be smooth, linear or constant in s, 
which is the index of the functional covariates x(s).}

\item{knots}{either the number of knots or a vector of the positions 
of the interior knots (for more details see \code{\link[mboost]{bbs}}).}

\item{boundary.knots}{boundary points at which to anchor the B-spline basis 
(default the range of the data). A vector (of length 2) 
for the lower and the upper boundary knot can be specified.}

\item{degree}{degree of the regression spline.}

\item{differences}{a non-negative integer, typically 1, 2 or 3. Defaults to 1.
If \code{differences} = \emph{k}, \emph{k}-th-order differences are used as 
a penalty (\emph{0}-th order differences specify a ridge penalty).}

\item{df}{trace of the hat matrix for the base-learner defining the 
base-learner complexity. Low values of \code{df} correspond to a 
large amount of smoothing and thus to "weaker" base-learners.}

\item{lambda}{smoothing parameter of the penalty, computed from \code{df} when \code{df} is specified.}

\item{center}{See \code{\link[mboost]{bbs}}. 
The effect is re-parameterized such that the unpenalized part of the fit is subtracted and only 
the penalized effect is fitted, using a spectral decomposition of the penalty matrix.  
The unpenalized, parametric part has then to be included in separate 
base-learners using \code{bsignal(..., inS = 'constant')} or \code{bsignal(..., inS = 'linear')} 
for first (\code{difference = 1}) and second (\code{difference = 2}) order difference penalty respectively. 
See the help on the argument \code{center} of \code{\link[mboost]{bbs}}.}

\item{cyclic}{if \code{cyclic = TRUE} the fitted coefficient function coincides at the boundaries 
(useful for cyclic covariates such as day time etc.).}

\item{Z}{a transformation matrix for the design-matrix over the index of the covariate.
\code{Z} can be calculated as the transformation matrix for a sum-to-zero constraint in the case
that all trajectories have the same mean 
(then a shift in the coefficient function is not identifiable).}

\item{penalty}{for \code{bsignal}, by default, \code{penalty = "ps"}, the difference penalty for P-splines is used, 
for \code{penalty = "pss"} the penalty matrix is transformed to have full rank, 
so called shrinkage approach by Marra and Wood (2011). 
For \code{bfpc} the penalty can be either \code{"identity"} for a ridge penalty 
(the default) or \code{"inverse"} to use the matrix with the inverse eigenvalues 
on the diagonal as penalty matrix or \code{"no"} for no penalty.}

\item{check.ident}{use checks for identifiability of the effect, based on Scheipl and Greven (2016) 
for linear functional effect using \code{bsignal} and 
based on Brockhaus et al. (2017) for historical effects using \code{bhist}}

\item{time}{vector for the index of the functional response y(time) 
giving the measurement points of the functional response.}

\item{limits}{defaults to \code{"s<=t"} for an historical effect with s<=t;
either one of \code{"s<t"} or \code{"s<=t"} for [l(t), u(t)] = [T1, t]; 
otherwise specify limits as a function for integration limits [l(t), u(t)]: 
function that takes \eqn{s} as the first and \code{t} as the second argument and returns 
\code{TRUE} for combinations of values (s,t) if \eqn{s} falls into the integration range for 
the given \eqn{t}.}

\item{standard}{the historical effect can be standardized with a factor. 
"no" means no standardization, "time" standardizes with the current value of time and 
"length" standardizes with the length of the integral}

\item{intFun}{specify the function that is used to compute integration weights in \code{s} 
over the functional covariate \eqn{x(s)}}

\item{inTime}{the historical effect can be smooth, linear or constant in time, 
which is the index of the functional response y(time).}

\item{pve}{proportion of variance explained by the first K functional principal components (FPCs): 
used to choose the number of functional principal components (FPCs).}

\item{npc}{prespecified value for the number K of FPCs (if given, this overrides \code{pve}).}

\item{npc.max}{maximal number K of FPCs to use; defaults to 15.}

\item{getEigen}{save the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Equally to the base-learners of package \code{mboost}: 

An object of class \code{blg} (base-learner generator) with a 
\code{dpp()} function (dpp, data pre-processing). 

The call of \code{dpp()} returns an object of class 
\code{bl} (base-learner) with a \code{fit()} function. The call to 
\code{fit()} finally returns an object of class \code{bm} (base-model).
}
\description{
Base-learners that fit effects of functional covariates.
}
\details{
\code{bsignal()} implements a base-learner for functional covariates to  
estimate an effect of the form \eqn{\int x_i(s)\beta(s)ds}. Defaults to a cubic  
B-spline basis with first difference penalties for \eqn{\beta(s)} and numerical 
integration over the entire range by using trapezoidal Riemann weights. 
If \code{bsignal()} is used within \code{FDboost()}, the base-learner of 
\code{timeformula} is attached, resulting in an effect varying over the index
of the response \eqn{\int x_i(s)\beta(s, t)ds} if \code{timeformula = bbs(t)}. 
The functional variable must be observed on one common grid \code{s}.  

\code{bconcurrent()} implements a concurrent effect for a functional covariate
on a functional response, i.e., an effect of the form \eqn{x_i(t)\beta(t)} for
a functional response \eqn{Y_i(t)} and concurrently observed covariate \eqn{x_i(t)}. 
\code{bconcurrent()} can only be used if \eqn{Y(t)} and \eqn{x(s)} are observed over
the same domain \eqn{s,t \in [T1, T2]}.  

\code{bhist()} implements a base-learner for functional covariates with 
flexible integration limits \code{l(t)}, \code{r(t)} and the possibility to
standardize the effect by \code{1/t} or the length of the integration interval. 
The effect is \eqn{stand * \int_{l(t)}^{r_{t}} x(s)\beta(t,s)ds}, where \eqn{stand} is 
the chosen standardization which defaults to 1. 
The base-learner defaults to a historical effect of the form 
\eqn{\int_{T1}^{t} x_i(s)\beta(t,s)ds}, 
where \eqn{T1} is the minimal index of \eqn{t} of the response \eqn{Y(t)}. 
The functional covariate must be observed on one common grid \code{s}.  
See Brockhaus et al. (2017) for details on historical effects.   

\code{bfpc()} is a base-learner for a linear effect of functional covariates based on 
functional principal component analysis (FPCA). 
For the functional linear effect \eqn{\int x_i(s)\beta(s)ds} the functional covariate 
and the coefficient function are both represented by a FPC basis. 
The functional covariate
\eqn{x(s)} is decomposed into \eqn{x(s) \approx \sum_{k=1}^K \xi_{ik} \Phi_k(s)} using 
\code{\link[refund]{fpca.sc}} for the truncated Karhunen-Loeve decomposition. 
Then \eqn{\beta(s)} is represented in the function
space spanned by \eqn{\Phi_k(s)}, k=1,...,K, see Scheipl et al. (2015) for details. 
As penalty matrix, the identity matrix is used. 
The implementation is similar to \code{\link[refund]{ffpc}}.  

It is recommended to use centered functional covariates with 
\eqn{\sum_i x_i(s) = 0} for all \eqn{s} in \code{bsignal()}-, 
\code{bhist()}- and \code{bconcurrent()}-terms. 
For centered covariates, the effects are centered per time-point of the response. 
If all effects are centered, the functional intercept 
can be interpreted as the global mean function. 

The base-learners for functional covariates cannot deal with any missing 
values in the covariates.
