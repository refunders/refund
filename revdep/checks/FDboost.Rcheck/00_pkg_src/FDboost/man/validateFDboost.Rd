\usage{
validateFDboost(object, response = NULL, folds = cv(rep(1,
  length(unique(object$id))), type = "bootstrap"), grid = 1:mstop(object),
  fun = NULL, getCoefCV = TRUE, riskopt = c("mean", "median"),
  mrdDelete = 0, refitSmoothOffset = TRUE, showProgress = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{fitted FDboost-object}

\item{response}{optional, specify a response vector for the computation of the prediction errors.
Defaults to \code{NULL} which means that the response of the fitted model is used.}

\item{folds}{a weight matrix with number of rows equal to the number of observed trajectories.}

\item{grid}{the grid over which the optimal number of boosting iterations (mstop) is searched.}

\item{fun}{if \code{fun} is \code{NULL}, the out-of-bag risk is returned. 
\code{fun}, as a function of \code{object}, 
may extract any other characteristic of the cross-validated models. These are returned as is.}

\item{getCoefCV}{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. Should the coefficients and predictions
be computed for all the models on the sampled data?}

\item{riskopt}{how is the optimal stopping iteration determined. Defaults to the mean, 
but median is possible as well.}

\item{mrdDelete}{Delete values that are \code{mrdDelete} percent smaller than the mean
of the response. Defaults to 0 which means that only response values being 0 
are not used in the calculation of the MRD (= mean relative deviation).}

\item{refitSmoothOffset}{logical, should the offset be refitted in each learning sample? 
Defaults to \code{TRUE}. In \code{\link[mboost]{cvrisk}} the offset of the original model fit in  
\code{object} is used in all folds.}

\item{showProgress}{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to \code{\link[parallel]{mclapply}}}
}
\value{
The function \code{validateFDboost} returns a \code{validateFDboost}-object, 
which is a named list containing: 
\item{response}{the response}
\item{yind}{the observation points of the response}
\item{id}{the id variable of the response}
\item{folds}{folds that were used}
\item{grid}{grid of possible numbers of boosting iterations}
\item{coefCV}{if \code{getCoefCV} is \code{TRUE} the estimated coefficient functions in the folds}
\item{predCV}{if \code{getCoefCV} is \code{TRUE} the out-of-bag predicted values of the response}
\item{oobpreds}{if the type of folds is curves the out-of-bag predictions for each trajectory}
\item{oobrisk}{the out-of-bag risk}
\item{oobriskMean}{the out-of-bag risk at the minimal mean risk}
\item{oobmse}{the out-of-bag mean squared error (MSE)}
\item{oobrelMSE}{the out-of-bag relative mean squared error (relMSE)}
\item{oobmrd}{the out-of-bag mean relative deviation (MRD)}
\item{oobrisk0}{the out-of-bag risk without consideration of integration weights}
\item{oobmse0}{the out-of-bag mean squared error (MSE) without consideration of integration weights}
\item{oobmrd0}{the out-of-bag mean relative deviation (MRD) without consideration of integration weights}
\item{format}{one of "FDboostLong" or "FDboost" depending on the class of the object}
\item{fun_ret}{list of what fun returns if fun was specified}

\description{
DEPRECATED! 
The function \code{validateFDboost()} is deprecated,  
use \code{\link{applyFolds}} and \code{\link{bootstrapCI}} instead.
}
\details{
The number of boosting iterations is an important hyper-parameter of boosting  
and can be chosen using the function \code{validateFDboost} as they compute
honest, i.e., out-of-bag, estimates of the empirical risk for different numbers of boosting iterations. 

The function \code{validateFDboost} is especially suited to models with functional response. 
Using the option \code{refitSmoothOffset} the offset is refitted on each fold. 
Note, that the function \code{validateFDboost} expects folds that give weights
per curve without considering integration weights. The integration weights of 
\code{object} are used to compute the empirical risk as integral. The argument \code{response} 
can be useful in simulation studies where the true value of the response is known but for 
the model fit the response is used with noise.
