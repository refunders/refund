\usage{
\method{stabsel}{FDboost}(x, refitSmoothOffset = TRUE, cutoff, q, PFER,
  folds = cvLong(x$id, weights = rep(1, l = length(x$id)), type =
  "subsampling", B = B), B = ifelse(sampling.type == "MB", 100, 50),
  assumption = c("unimodal", "r-concave", "none"), sampling.type = c("SS",
  "MB"), papply = mclapply, verbose = TRUE, eval = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{fitted FDboost-object}

\item{refitSmoothOffset}{logical, should the offset be refitted in each learning sample? 
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cutoff}{cutoff between 0.5 and 1. Preferably a value between 0.6 and 0.9 should be used.}

\item{q}{number of (unique) selected variables (or groups of variables depending on the model) 
that are selected on each subsample.}

\item{PFER}{upper bound for the per-family error rate. This specifies the amount of falsely 
selected base-learners, which is tolerated. See details of \code{\link[mboost]{stabsel}}.}

\item{folds}{a weight matrix with number of rows equal to the number of observations, 
see \code{{cvLong}}. Usually one should not change the default here as subsampling 
with a fraction of 1/2 is needed for the error bounds to hold. One usage scenario where 
specifying the folds by hand might be the case when one has dependent data (e.g. clusters) and 
thus wants to draw clusters (i.e., multiple rows together) not individuals.}

\item{B}{number of subsampling replicates. Per default, we use 50 complementary pairs for the error 
bounds of Shah & Samworth (2013) and 100 for the error bound derived in Meinshausen & Buehlmann (2010). 
As we use \code{B} complementary pairs in the former case this leads to \code{2B} subsamples.}

\item{assumption}{Defines the type of assumptions on the distributions of the selection probabilities 
and simultaneous selection probabilities. Only applicable for \code{sampling.type = "SS"}. 
For \code{sampling.type = "MB"} we always use \code{"none"}.}

\item{sampling.type}{use sampling scheme of of Shah & Samworth (2013), i.e., with complementary pairs 
(\code{sampling.type = "SS"}), or the original sampling scheme of Meinshausen & Buehlmann (2010).}

\item{papply}{(parallel) apply function, defaults to mclapply. Alternatively, parLapply can be used. 
In the latter case, usually more setup is needed (see example of cvrisk for some details).}

\item{verbose}{logical (default: TRUE) that determines wether warnings should be issued.}

\item{eval}{logical. Determines whether stability selection is evaluated (\code{eval = TRUE}; default) 
or if only the parameter combination is returned.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to \code{\link[mboost]{cvrisk}} or \code{\link{validateFDboost}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{stabsel} with a special print method. 
For the elements of the object, see \code{\link[mboost]{stabsel}}
}
\description{
Function for stability selection with functional response. Per default the sampling is done
on the level of curves and if the model contains a smooth functional intercept, this intercept 
is refittedn in each sampling fold.
}
\details{
The number of boosting iterations is an important hyper-parameter of the boosting algorithms 
and can be chosen using the functions \code{cvrisk.FDboost} and \code{validateFDboost} as they compute
honest, i.e. out-of-bag, estimates of the empirical risk for different numbers of boosting iterations. 
The weights (zero weights correspond to test cases) are defined via the folds matrix, 
see \code{\link[mboost]{cvrisk}} in package mboost. 
See Hofner et al. (2015) for the combination of stability selection and component-wise boosting.
